#+TITLE: Todo

* TODO Less hard-coded numbers
- CLI-flags
- config file
* TODO implement shutdown function [[file:/home/max/devel/go/tcp-chat/chat/server.go::41][file]]
- kick all clients
- message all clients the server is shutting down
* TODO user hirarchy/administration system
- "You do not have permission to issue this command. Please contact an administrator if this is an issue." hihi xD
* DONE pick something different than the ip address to seperate users from another [[file:/home/max/devel/go/tcp-chat/chat/room.go::9][file]]
- randomly generated identifiers? [[https://blog.kowalczyk.info/article/JyRZ/generating-good-unique-ids-in-go.html][website with some go implementations]]
* TODO more commands [1/2]
** DONE /members: list all members of the current room
As an example:
#+begin_src go
func (serv *server) ListMembers(client *client) {
	var members []string
	for member := range client.room.Members() {
		rooms = append(members, member)
	}

	client.msg(fmt.Sprintf("Members of room '%s': %s", client.room.name, strings.Join(rooms, ", ")))
}
#+end_src
Method `room.Members()` must first be implemented.
** TODO /msg command shouldn't exist, should be the default
* TODO reformat code so it complies with Go's idioms
* TODO FIXME crash when command body is empty
- control/check body of messages/commands, shouldn't be too long either
